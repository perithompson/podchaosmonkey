# podchaosmonkey
PodChaosMonkey is a simple controller created to run pod delete operations inside Kubernetes

## Description
The PodChaosMonkey simplifies randomised pod deletions utilising a controller to interact with the api-server in a given
cluster.  It provides the Monkey [CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions) 
```yaml
apiVersion: podchaos.podchaosmonkey.pt/v1alpha1
kind: Monkey
metadata:
  name: monkey-sample
spec:
  noop: true # choose to log only or run the pod delete operation
  interval: 1m # choose to minimum interval to run operations default: 30s
  namespace: workloads # choose to minimum interval to run operations
  selector: # label selector for choosing the pods to delete
    matchLabels:
      chaosAllowed: "true" #example label
```
Once the **Monkey** Resource is loaded into the cluster, **podchaosmonkey** will add a status condition to indicate that the experiments are active from a given time. At every interval specified a pod matching the search criteria from the cluster will be deleted at random.

## Background
This controller was built using the kubernetes-sig project [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) project which is an SDK created as part of the kubernetes project as a means to simplify the creation of [custom resource definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions).  As part of this resources such as RBAC and deployment templates are generated to standardise and improve reliability.

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) providing a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources and running the chaos experiments.


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/podchaosmonkey:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/podchaosmonkey:tag
```

4. Deploy a sample workload
```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/sample-deployment.yaml
```

5. Create the Monkey resource:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/podchaos_v1alpha1_monkey.yaml
```

6. Watch the Monkey do his thing!

```sh
watch kubectl get pods -n workloads
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
